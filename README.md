Create a galaxy using BetterGalaxyShape.py

Verify you like it using DisplayToPutinTheDatabaseV2.py It will not put it in the database I am just leaving the name like that for now

Take the galaxy.json file that is created and put it in the folder with index.html, script.js and style.css 

go to the folder and type cmd in the taskbar
When cmd opens 
copy this in 
python -m http.server 8000
Then open your browser in localhost:8000

You may need to install your pytho libraies I did not take note of what I needed sorry.
